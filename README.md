======
An HTTP & SPDY client for Android and Java applications. For more information see [the website][1] and [the wiki][2].

Java 1.6 Comptibility Note
---------------------
This library should be Java 1.6 compatible except for okhttp-tests. If building
this module with an IDE, make sure to remove the okhttp-tests module before
building in order to avoid compilation errors.

How to use
----------
Clone this repository and then build it with your favorite tool (tested with
IntelliJ).

See [here](https://github.com/square/okhttp) for the original repository's
